Designed and built from the ground up.  It is in the early stages but will eventually be a full-stack application allowing the owners to easily update it with zero coding knowledge through Node and Mongodb.  

**Tech used:**

## Future Plans:

- Fix spacing in footer for widescreen
- add tabs as discussed with client
